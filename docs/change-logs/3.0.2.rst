.. rubric:: Feature

#. Added the `eCAMI <https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/36/7/2068/5651014>`_ tool and removed `Hotpep`.
#. Changed the format of ``cgc.out`` to make it easy to read.
#. Re-arranged the code. The command line is ``run_dbcan`` now without the suffix ``.py``.
#. The database files under db folder is now hosted through ``Git-LFS``. To download the complete db files, please use the command ``git lfs pull``
   (Note: To use git lfs, please check the installation guide at https://git-lfs.github.com/).
#. ``Dockerfile`` is updated and we simplify the installation step.
