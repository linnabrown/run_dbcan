A standalone tool of http://bcb.unl.edu/dbCAN2/

Rewritten by Huang Le in the Zhang Lab at NKU; V1 version was written by Tanner Yohe of the Yin lab at NIU.

Updated
---

- v2.0.11 please use `pip install run-dbcan==2.0.11` for update
    1. Add ec number prediction to hotpep result; 
    2. 04/21/2020 dbCAN2 Hotpep PPR patterns updated to most recent release of CAZyDB (2019). Also missing group EC# files for families added in;
    3. Revising the output name file in hotpep as random number, to make the program more robust for paralleing running.
    4. Prioritizing the CAZyme prediction over TF/TC/STP prediction when preparing gff input file for CGC-Finder. 
    5. Rewrite the installation steps. Recommend user to use customized virtual environment (use certain python version).
    6. Fix the duplicate ACC of tf-2.hmm to make it compatiable for the newest hmmer (3.3). Delete version limitatino to hmmer.
    7. Fix the prodigal predicted gff file end with `";"` problem.

- v2.0.6 released on Feb 17, 2020, please use `pip install run-dbcan==2.0.6` for update
We forgo FragGeneScan because this program does not work now. We use Prodigal instead. So, you don't need to use conda install fraggenescan now.
We add extra information `EC number` to the last columns of Hotpep output to make it consistent with previous Hotpep result.


Function
----
- Accepts user input
- Predicts genes if needed
- Runs input against HMMER, DIAMOND, and Hotpep
- Optionally predicts CGCs with CGCFinder

Support Platform
-----
Linux(Ubuntu, CentOS), MacOS

Python Package Usage
-----
1. Please install [Anoconda](https://www.anaconda.com) first.

2. Create virtual environment with dependencies and activate the virtual environment.

```
conda create -n run_dbcan python=3.8 diamond hmmer prodigal -c conda-forge -c bioconda
conda activate run_dbcan
```

3. Install this package with pip.

```
pip install run-dbcan==2.0.11
```


4. Database Installation.
```
test -d db || mkdir db
cd db \
    && wget http://bcb.unl.edu/dbCAN2/download/Databases/V9/CAZyDB.07312020.fa && diamond makedb --in CAZyDB.07312020.fa -d CAZy \
    && wget http://bcb.unl.edu/dbCAN2/download/Databases/V9/dbCAN-HMMdb-V9.txt && mv dbCAN-HMMdb-V9.txt dbCAN.txt && hmmpress dbCAN.txt \
    && wget http://bcb.unl.edu/dbCAN2/download/Databases/tcdb.fa && diamond makedb --in tcdb.fa -d tcdb \
    && wget http://bcb.unl.edu/dbCAN2/download/Databases/tf-1.hmm && hmmpress tf-1.hmm \
    && wget http://bcb.unl.edu/dbCAN2/download/Databases/tf-2.hmm && hmmpress tf-2.hmm \
    && wget http://bcb.unl.edu/dbCAN2/download/Databases/stp.hmm && hmmpress stp.hmm \
    && cd ../ && wget http://bcb.unl.edu/dbCAN2/download/Samples/EscheriaColiK12MG1655.fna \
    && wget http://bcb.unl.edu/dbCAN2/download/Samples/EscheriaColiK12MG1655.faa \
    && wget http://bcb.unl.edu/dbCAN2/download/Samples/EscheriaColiK12MG1655.gff
```
5. (Optional) SignalP Installation.
Our program include Signalp Petitide prediction with SignalP. Make sure to set `use_signalP=True` and *have to* obtain your own academic license of SignalP and download it from [here](http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/cgi-bin/sw_request?signalp+4.1), and then move tarball (Signalp-4.1.tar.gz) into `run_dbcan/tools/` by yourself. Following statement is singalP-4.0 installation instruction.
```
mkdir -p run_dbcan/tools && run_dbcan/tools/
tar xzf Signalp-4.1.tar.gz && cd Signalp-4.1
```
Edit the paragraph labeled  "GENERAL SETTINGS, CUSTOMIZE ..." in the top of
   the file 'signalp'. The following twovmandatory variables need to be set:

   	SIGNALP		full path to the signalp-4.1 directory on your system
	outputDir	where to store temporary files (writable to all users)

   In addition,  for practical reasons,  it is possible to limit the number of
   input sequences allowed per run (MAX_ALLOWED_ENTRIES). For example:
```
###############################################################################
#               GENERAL SETTINGS: CUSTOMIZE TO YOUR SITE
###############################################################################

# full path to the signalp-4.1 directory on your system (mandatory)
BEGIN {
    $ENV{SIGNALP} = '/home/abc/Desktop/run_dbcan/tools/signalp-4.1';
}

# determine where to store temporary files (must be writable to all users)
my $outputDir = "/home/abc/Desktop/run_dbcan/tools/signalp-4.1/output";

# max number of sequences per run (any number can be handled)
my $MAX_ALLOWED_ENTRIES=100000;
```

And then, use this command:

```
sudo cp signalp /usr/bin/signalp
sudo chmod 755 /usr/bin/signalp
```
6. Check Program.
```
run_dbcan.py EscheriaColiK12MG1655.fna prok --out_dir output_EscheriaColiK12MG1655
```

Docker version Usage(Don't Use it, because of revising, Please use Python Package above instead )
----
1. Make sure docker is installed on your computer successfully.
2. Docker pull image
```
docker pull haidyi/run_dbcan:latest
```
3. Run. Mount `input sequence file` and `output directory` to the container.
```
docker run --name <preferred_name> -v <host-path>:<container-path> -it haidyi/run_dbcan:latest python run_dbcan.py <input_file> [params] --out_dir <output_dir>
```

Update info
----
- 10/08/2019
We create a [python package](https://pypi.org/project/run-dbcan/#files).
Be sure to install [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/) or Miniconda first, and then use the following commands to install our program one time.
We strongly recommend you to use virtual environment to seperate your own system and this executive scripts. Please make sure to use `conda install -c bioconda diamond hmmer prodigal` and database installation script to have the appropriate dependencies and database installed and configured. Thanks for suggestion and contribution from [tesujimath](https://github.com/tesujimath) .

- 04/15/2019
We created a [docker image](https://hub.docker.com/r/haidyi/run_dbcan) of run_dbcan. Make sure to install docker properly. Thanks for suggestion and contributions from [Haidyi](https://github.com/HaidYi).

- 1/10/2019
We rewritted program and added `stp hmmdb` signature gene in CGC_Finder.py (stp means signal transduction proteins; the hmmdb was constructed by Catherine Ausland of the Yin lab at NIU). Then Change tfdb from `tfdb` to `tf.hmm`, which is added to `db/` directory (tfdb was a fasta format sequence file, which contains just bacterial transcription factor proteins; tf.hmm is a hmmer format file containing hmms downloaded from the Pfam and SUPERFAMILY database according to the DBD database: http://www.transcriptionfactor.org). Also, our project updates dbCAN-HMM db(V8) and CAZy db. Furthermore, we fixed bugs in HotPep python version to fit python 3 user. Last but not least, we added certain codes to make it robust. Thanks for hmmscan-parser.py suggestion from [Mick](mick.watson@roslin.ed.ac.uk).

RUN & OUTPUT
----
Use following command to run the program.
```
run_dbcan.py [inputFile] [inputType] [-c AuxillaryFile] [-t Tools] etc.
```

Several files will be produced via `run_dbcan.py`. They are as follows:

	uniInput - The unified input file for the rest of the tools
			(created by prodigal if a nucleotide sequence was used)

	Hotpep.out - the output from the Hotpep run

	diamond.out - the output from the diamond blast

	hmmer.out - the output from the hmmer run

	tf.out - the output from the diamond blast predicting TF's for CGCFinder

	tc.out - the output from the diamond blast predicting TC's for CGCFinder

	cgc.gff - GFF input file for CGCFinder

	cgc.out - ouput from the CGCFinder run

	overview.txt - Details the CAZyme predictions across the three tools with signalp results

EXAMPLE
----

An example setup is available in the example directory. Included in this directory are two FASTA sequences (one protein, one nucleotide).

To run this example type, run:

```
run_dbcan.py EscheriaColiK12MG1655.fna prok --out_dir output_EscheriaColiK12MG1655
```
or

```
run_dbcan.py EscheriaColiK12MG1655.faa protein --out_dir output_EscheriaColiK12MG1655
```

While this example directory contains all the databases you will need (already formatted) and the Hotpep and Prodigal programs, you will still need to have the remaining programs installed on your machine (DIAMOND, HMMER, etc.).

To run the examples with CGCFinder turned on, run:
```
run_dbcan.py EscheriaColiK12MG1655.fna prok -c cluster --out_dir output_EscheriaColiK12MG1655
```

or

```
run_dbcan.py EscheriaColiK12MG1655.faa protein -c EscheriaColiK12MG1655.gff --out_dir output_EscheriaColiK12MG1655
```

Notice that the protein command has a GFF file following the -c option. A GFF or BED format file with gene position information is required to run CGCFinder when using a protein input.
